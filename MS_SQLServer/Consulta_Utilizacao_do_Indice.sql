/*
 - All zero values mean that the table is not used, or the SQL Server service restarted recently.
 - An index with zero or small number of seeks, scans or lookups and large number of updates is a useless index and should be removed, after verifying with the system owner, as the main purpose of adding the index is speeding up the read operations.
 - An index that is scanned heavily with zero or small number of seeks means that the index is badly used and should be replaced with more optimal one.
 - An index with large number of Lookups means that we need to optimize the index by adding the frequently looked up columns to the existing index non-key columns using the INCLUDE clause.
 - A table with a very large number of Scans indicates that SELECT * queries are heavily used, retrieving more columns than what is required, or the index statistics should be updated.
 - A Clustered index with large number of Scans means that a new Non-clustered index should be created to cover a non-covered query.
 - Dates with NULL values mean that this action has not occurred yet.
 - Large scans are OK in small tables.
 - Your index is not here, then no action is performed on that index yet.
